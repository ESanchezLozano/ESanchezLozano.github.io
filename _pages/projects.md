Reinforcement Learning for Chatbots
======

The goal of this project is to incorporate reinforcement learning (deep Q learning) to the chatbots tool existing in Python.
The project is done in Python and combines the existing libraries: 
- Pytorch: [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)
- Gym (Python): [https://github.com/openai/gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
- Chatterbox (Python): [https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
